<p><h3>Teon's Biography</h3></p>
My name is Teon Parker. I was born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina on September 24, 1996.
I am a senior computer science student from Raleigh, North Carolina. I graduated from Wake Forest 
Heritage High School in 2014. I decided that I would major in computer science in my junior year of high
school because it had always been my dream to be a scientist ever since I was in elementary school. I am,
in a way, fulfilling this dream even though I was more interested in the natural sciences.
</p>
<p>I like to think that I am a well-rounded individual. I have interests in many different things from
various unrelated fields. My favorite sports are any combat sport which includes boxing, mixed martial arts,
karate, judo, and wrestling(not WWE). I love philosophy, psychology, and genetics and evolution. I even
used to be a car fanatic when I was younger. </p></strong></i></u></body>
