    <h2 class="fontStyle"><center>Origins of Mixed Martial Arts</center></h2>
    <p class="fontStyle">There is very little recorded history on the first martial arts, but considering that humans are naturally violent, and that we all originate from Africa, the first martial arts most likely originated in Africa. Humans practiced martial arts throughout
      the globe as a means of gaining an advantage in defeating untrained opponents for the purpose of self-defense and all-out war. We do know that the ancient Greeks and Romans practiced pankration which is a form of wrestling in which there were basically
      no rules -- eye-gouging, scratching, biting, groin shots, and strikes to the back head -- all of which were legal strikes back then. They are illegal in modern day sports. The first martial arts practicioner to break down the barriers between the
      various styles is Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee may have been a phenomenal actor, but he was also a philospher and an avid martial arts practicitioner. He saw that there were flaws in each individual fighting style, so he told people to not be loyal to any
      one martial arts because it makes you tunnel visioned and vulnerable to the other styles that can defeat yours. It is a shame that he died in the early 70s considering the revolution that he was partaking in for the perception of martial arts. A
      <i>boxer</i> cannot defeat a <i>wrestler</i>, while a <i>wrestler</i> cannot defeat a <i>jujitsu</i> fighter. However, a mixed martial artist can defeat any single practicing martial artist.

    <h2 class="fontStyle"><center> Early Days of Mixed Martial Arts</center></h2>
    <p class="fontStyle" id="left">
      The UFC held its first mixed martial arts combat on November 12, 1993 so roughly 25 years ago. The fighters came from various backgrounds and despite the fact that Bruce Lee advocated the acquisition of multiple combat disciplines 20 years prior, the
      fighters were primarily <span id="emphasis">one-dimensioal strikers</span> or <span id="emphasis"> grapplers</span>. The winner of this tournament, as you can see in the image on the right is Royce Gracie, a mixed martial artist who introduced
      a fighting style that was unknown to the western world: <span id="emphasis2"> Brazilian Jujitsu!</span> He competed against steroid-using American wrestlers like Ken Shamrock who outweighed this lanky 6 feet 178 pound Brazilian by 50 or more pounds
      through technique instead of pure strength. Mind over matter could not have been more relevant for this event. Fighters in the west began to study the intricaties of this art because its dominance could not be overstated.

    <h2 class="fontStyle"><center>Modern MMA Masters of Multiple Styles</center> </h2>
    <p class="fontStyle" id="format">This is the time period in MMA beginnning in the late 90s through the early 2000s where fighters would learn multiple disciplines of martial arts and be experts in at least 2 different styles. Many of the fighters that are considered legends of the
      sport such as Bas Rutten who was an expert in karate, muay thai, and wrestling. He retired with a 22 fight undefeated streak which included wins with knockouts and submissions. This time period also included Anderson Silva and Fedor. They were both
      just as dangerous with striking as they were with grappling. You did <span id="emphasis2"> NOT </span> want to fight these guys. It is oft debated which fighter was more dominant in their prime as they both fought in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_Fighting_Championships">Pride Fighting Champion</a>, a Japanese fighting organization which actually was more popular globally than the UFC was at the time. Undoubtedly the greatest fighter to ever grace
      the octagon in mixed martial arts has to be Jon Jones. He is a collegiate wrestler who fights in the UFC in the 205 pound division and dominated almost every fighter to ever face him. He won the belt at 23 after defeating a Pride legend in Shogun
      Rua in dominant fashion via technical knockout. He broke the record for most title defenses at 8. He also has never been defeated after 23 bouts <span id="emphasis">(one of his losses is due to a referee mistake).</span>What made him special is
      he could nullify the powerful strikers with his own unpredicatable styles, submit the grapplers, and out kickbox the volume strikers. He had no known weaknesses as well. <strong>Unbeatable</strong>, that he was.

    <h2 class="fontStyle"><center>Boxer vs MMA Fighter</center></h2>
    <p class="fontStyle" id="format">
      Floyd Mayweather is one of the greatest boxers ever who, before his bout with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor">Conor McrGegor</a>, the LHW UFC champion at the time, had a perfect record of 49-0. Conor challenged Floyd to a
      boxing match in 2017 to reign over the 2 sports as the most prominent fighter to ever live. Many MMA fans and Irish rooted for Conor Mcgregor even to win this bout, as they believed that his banter about him landing that one "left hand" which will
      "bounce his head off the canvas" was any more than an attempt to hype up the fight. Yes, Floyd was 40 years old and weighed 25 lbs lighter along with shorter reach, but he has been boxing in the square circle for over 20 years. On August 29, 2017
      they had their boxing match and Floyd Mayweather won the fight by 10th round technical knockout against the younger, larger fighter. Had he have lost, MMA fighters would have lost complete respect for boxing as a sport and for Floyd Mayweather's
      legacy.
