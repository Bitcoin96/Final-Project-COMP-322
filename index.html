      <p><strong>My name is Angelo Bradley. I am from Charlotte, NC and after 2 years at Wake Technical Community College and 3 years at North Carolina
      Agricultural and Technical State University, I will be graduating in the spring of 2019 with a Bachelors in Computer Science. Outside of writing code, most of my hobbies and interests
    revolve around art, music, and ancient history. I have wide ranging tastes and I am constantly looking for activities and possible career paths that will incorporate all of my interests.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>My name is Teon Parker. I was born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina on September 24, 1996. I am a senior computer science student from Raleigh, North Carolina. I graduated from Wake Forest Heritage High School in 2014. I decided that I would major
        in computer science in my junior year of high school because it had always been my dream to be a scientist ever since I was in elementary school. I am, in a way, fulfilling this dream even though I was more interested in the natural sciences.
        I like to think that I am a well-rounded individual. I have interests in many different things from various unrelated fields. My favorite sports are any combat sport which includes boxing, mixed martial arts, karate, judo, and wrestling(not WWE).
        I love philosophy, psychology, and genetics and evolution. I even used to be a car fanatic when I was younger. </strong></p>
