<br>

<p>In 2013&#44; I was awarded an IT internship at G4S Compliance and Investigations which evolved into a full-time position in 7 weeks&#8217; time. There&#44; I was part of a small team which was responsible for all IT and IT-adjacent issues for over 900 employees&#44; most of whom were working remotely as private investigators. Because of this&#44; we dealt with a wide variety of computing systems&#44; operating systems&#44; devices and network configurations. Assistance was handled in person&#44; over the phone&#44; via chat&#44; email and remote control of devices. I worked both from home and onsite at the Raleigh HQ&#44; often at odd hours as IT issues arose.</p>
<p>In 2014&#44; I enrolled at <u>Wake Technical Community College</u> and subsequently graduated with an <strong>Associate in Science</strong> degree in 2016. After graduation&#44; I transferred to <u>North Carolina A&T State University</u> where I am currently majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong>&#44; minoring in <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong>.</p>
<p>I am open to and excited about the opportunity to improve my IT and Software Development skills and to gain exposure to new technologies and industry methodologies.</p>
