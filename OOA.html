The Out of Africa theory is an extension of the theory of evolution of man which predicates that man evolved from the primate ancestors. Not
everyone follows this theory since there are many holes ragarding the links between various intermediate species that lead up to the modern man.
One thing that is certain is all modern humans originate from the Homo Sapiens in many African countries such as Ethiopia and Morocco over 
250,000 years ago. This theory formed due to the myriad of fossils discovered throughout Africa, Asian, Europe, and the North and South American
continents. The carbon dating methods reveal the ages of the fossils that follow a developmental cline from the African Homo Sapiens to the
Caucasian and Mongoloid Homo Sapiens.

<p class = "fontStyle" id = "format"> Around 100,000 years ago, humans began to migrate from the continent of Africa and enter Eurasia. 
Because of that, we see humans that still retain some semblance of the ancient African phenotype such as the Negritos in southeast Asia or 
the Jarawa people in the Andaman Islands. However, many humans bred with the Denisovans and Neanderthals which produced the modern day races
in Asian and Europe. All non-Africans have been found to have a portion of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA indicating a lineage that varies 
depending on the origins of your ancestors in the past <em>50,000 to 100,000 years.</em></p>
